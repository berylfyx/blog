# Remember You Are a Legend

*2016*

I have always known that I am a legend.

A singularity exploded with a bang and expanded into the universe; matter attracted, collided, and coalesced into stars. For billions of years, matter and energy entertained themselves in the pitch-black vacuum, performing changes of light and shadow and molecular combinations that no one appreciated. In the liquid oceans of Earth, cells were miraculously conceived; they grew, divided, and died. Plants became animals, and animals stepped onto land. Astralopithecus shed their fur, and primeval forests gave way to skyscrapers.

I emerged from three hundred million competitors to unite with my mother's egg. For nineteen years, I have not encountered plague or war, nor experienced murder or starvation—trilobites have vanished, Neanderthals are extinct, Roman emperors were assassinated, three thousand infants were miscarried, yet I still exist thrivingly. My blood flows with carbon atoms from the teeth of Cretaceous dinosaurs; I write these words using energy produced by nuclear fusion at the core of the sun. I have seen golden afternoon sunlight shine into the library; I have imagined the conversations between Confucius and his students thousands of years ago; I can run, jump, and think.

My existence itself is a legend. It is like the track *Fountain of Life* by Two Steps From Hell—majestic and epic. The forging of this legend encompasses the formation of the universe, the birth of life, the evolution of species, and the benevolence of human society toward me thus far. Every link is breathtakingly miraculous.

Regrettably, I often forget this.

Just as Anna Karenina, born of nobility, forgot the extreme fortune of having no worries about food or clothing; just as students forget the infinite possibilities of life outside of grade rankings; our environment permeates and influences us, shaping a "well-mouth sky" set of values for everyone within it. Getting good grades in school to get a better job, seeking promotion opportunities in the workplace to earn more money—these are the directions of struggle we cannot escape while living in society. When no one around me realizes the legendary magnificence of life itself, I cannot help but identify with the anxiety of the times, throwing myself into personal struggle like everyone else, and often sighing dejectedly at my own mediocrity and dispensability.

The introduction to the "Cosmology" topic on Zhihu is: "Look over society, peek at the universe."

—I like this sentence very much.

It is inevitable that thinking is influenced or even limited by the environment. For ninety-nine percent of my life, I will probably only be able to throw myself into personal struggle while sighing at my own dispensability. But occasionally—when lying on a deck chair in my rural hometown watching the twinkling stars on a summer night; when sipping a cappuccino by the window of a café in Wudaokou watching pedestrians; when discovering in the middle of Tonle Sap Lake that the radius of what I can see is equal with myself as the center; when constipated on the toilet without a phone—I can also let myself stare blankly for a while, looking over this value system that has submerged my entire life, secretly thinking of the heaven and earth, the cosmos and the prehistoric wasteland, thinking of the wild horses starving to death on the African plains, thinking of the smoke of war on the other side of the world at this moment and the smoke on this land at the other end of time, and then discovering with shock: I really am a legend.

It is hard to say what substantial benefit occasionally remembering one's legendary nature can bring to life.

I still didn't have anyone to watch the movie with me when *Your Name* was released; I still couldn't resist eating fried chicken late at night and blaming myself deeply the next day; I still worried about my GPA and didn't dare to be "reckless with youth." But in those few minutes of remembering that I am a legend, liberating my beating heart from the equally beating surroundings to face the Milky Way, I can always reap some kind of profound satisfaction, as if I have established some distant and subtle connection with this ancient, dead, dark universe.

Such satisfaction is enough for me to remind the people around me from time to time: You must occasionally remember that you are a legend, too.
