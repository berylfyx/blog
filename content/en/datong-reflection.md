# We built a beloved product but shut it down: A reflection on Datong

*Published on June 19, 2025*

A few years ago, a family member of mine was diagnosed with a rare disease. While researching it, I realized that the Chinese internet had little high-quality information about the disease, whereas the English web offered abundant educational resources and cutting-edge research papers. I wanted to bridge this gap — to break down language barriers and make high-quality English information equally accessible to non-English speakers. This mission became so compelling that I decided to leave my job at Google to pursue it full-time, because I felt I would regret it for the rest of my life if I hadn’t tried my best. That’s how the story of Datong began.

The project is named “Datong (大同)”, an ancient Chinese philosophical concept meaning “Great Unity”. Datong’s vision — democratizing high-quality information — deeply resonated with both our investors and team members.

We secured seed funding from MiraclePlus (previously YC China), who provided invaluable support and resources throughout our journey. We attracted amazing engineers to join the mission as part-time contributors, each lending their unique expertise and dedication. We hired proactive interns who learned quickly, and I am proud of their growth during their time with us.

From day one, the product vision was clear: to create a Google-like experience for Chinese users. English Google search was the state-of-the-art information entry point at that time, so we aimed to deliver a comparable experience in Chinese. Our product would translate user queries into English, search across the web, and return translated, relevant results.

### Organic growth

In August 2024, we announced the product on various online forums, which led to a 10x organic growth. People voluntarily promoted Datong on multiple platforms, the daily search volume grew from hundreds to thousands within weeks. For the next nine months, Datong maintained a stable monthly active user base of around 40,000 and daily search traffic of roughly 3,000.

At that initial launch, the product was still immature. Users reported that web page translation only worked reliably for about half of the pages. Some flagged inappropriate content due to the lack of content filtering. Typing “datong.info” was cumbersome, especially for Android users relying on handwriting input. An Android app quickly became a common request.

In the next few months, we set out to resolve all of these problems. We built what we believe was the best web page translation product available — with stability that even surpassed Google’s — and filed a patent for it. We added robust, multi-layer content safety mechanisms to meet regulatory standards. We launched a well-received Android app rated 5 stars on Xiaomi App Store.

### Word-of-mouth wasn’t enough

I believed that the product itself was the only thing that matters, as long as we relentlessly improve the product every day, the user experience would eventually reach a tipping point that would trigger viral organic growth. While we did see word-of-mouth growth, the pace was slow.

We conducted user interviews via pop-up invitations on the search results page, offering gift cards as incentives. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive — users gave an average recommendation score of 9/10, and many had discovered Datong through friends or family. However, this high score hid a crucial growth bottleneck. We learned that search engines are simply not a natural topic of conversation. Unlike a restaurant or a movie, you would only mention a search engine when you happen to be in a specific discussion about them. Even our most enthusiastic users admitted they hadn’t had a chance to recommend Datong for months, despite loving the product.

Still, we think the value proposition has been verified. A retired professor used Datong to explore topics of personal interest in the English internet, finding information unavailable elsewhere. A designer leveraged Datong to read English guides on how to sell products on Temu, she found them to be much more useful than the Chinese ones. A delivery worker without a college education used Datong to research his parents’ disease, he found that the English articles provided detailed information such as the etiological explanation of the disease, which cannot be found on other Chinese platforms.

In users’ own words, they love Datong because “its result is more accurate than other products”, and they do find translated English information useful. Convinced of our value proposition, we decided to scale up the user base through advertising and marketing.

We advertised across multiple platforms — Xiaohongshu, Google, Bing, Baidu, Zhihu, WeChat, etc. Tens of thousands of CNY in advertising spend led to millions of impressions, yet the retention after one month was negligible. Lacking marketing expertise, our campaigns were far from optimal, and the messaging wasn’t as compelling as it could have been.

I consulted marketing experts, previously successful startup founders, as well as our investors about the situation, and their advice was remarkably consistent: We need to address a niche market first, where Datong becomes the go-to option for all users of a particular usage scenario, and effective marketing becomes easy and natural once the target audience is clear.

We explored several potential niche markets — students, rare disease patients, professionals — and interviewed people from each group. While some appreciated Datong, most were already satisfied with existing solutions. For example, most rare disease patients found existing Chinese forums and community groups, though less scientifically rigorous, sufficiently met their immediate needs for peer support and general understanding. In each of these segments, only a small percentage were willing to switch to a new tool for “better information quality”, making it difficult to identify a niche market where Datong’s value was broadly compelling.

The existing user base of 40k MAU was not enough to make Datong a profitable business. It was a heartbreaking decision — but after nine months without meaningful growth, we chose to shut down Datong in May 2025 and return the remaining funds to our investor.

### Key Learnings

Looking back at this journey, a few important learnings emerged.

**A dedicated founding team is crucial for ambitious ventures.** I have been a solo founder, and that proved to be a significant disadvantage in many ways.

**(1) Single point of failure.** While we had great part-time contributors and interns, having only one person fully committed meant a single point of failure — when I lacked direction, the project stagnates. This had a profound personal cost. I woke up nearly every day feeling stressed and anxious, worried that we were on the brink of an abyss and that I might not know the best thing to do. I have learned that anxiety isn’t helpful, that it is the cognitive ability best leveraged when I am calm that can solve problems, but I never fully overcame it.

It’s possible that another dedicated, intelligent individual could have figured a way out of the growth problem. Moreover, as YC highlights, the simple motivation of not wanting to let each other down could become the superpower that takes the team through extremely low times.

**(2) Lack of peer-reviews.** Peer reviews are proven to improve work quality and efficiency. However, most of the time I had to work alone, without people to discuss problems with. What could have been easy and happy improvement ideas from casual chats became one person’s strenuous effort. Problems like growth strategy blind spots could have been surfaced much earlier and addressed more effectively through peer-review and informal discussions.

**(3) You need a real organization to scale.** I was hesitant to hire, concerned about our ability to provide stable employment (a valid concern given our lack of revenue). To maximize productivity, I tried to become a machine. I worked from 6AM to midnight, juggling product design, engineering, customer engagement, marketing, regulatory compliance, finances and taxes, and more. But there’s only so much one person can do, I soon hit the hard limit of one individual’s bandwidth; an organization is needed to scale productivity.

The fact that I was a solo founder wasn’t a coincidence. The best cofounders come from the network that you are already familiar with, yet I did not have a big network. Visibility and reputation are the best ways to connect with potential cofounders, and I hope this post to be instrumental for this purpose.

**A clear vision for go-to-market and commercialization is as important as a clear vision for the product.** I have learned that a clear vision is half of the work. While bringing an imagined ideal to reality is undeniably challenging, a clear vision is so powerful that the hard work of implementation feels like everything naturally falling into place.

I had a clear vision for the product — a Google-like high-quality information entry point that I would personally love and recommend, that users would embrace and share — and we delivered exactly that.

However, there wasn’t a clear vision for go-to-market, growth, and commercialization strategies. We had only vague wishful thinking for these important topics: If users love this product, they will recommend it to friends and family, there will be viral organic growth, and we will be able to advertise based on the large user base.

I learned it the hard way that a good product alone is not enough; it needs to be accompanied by equally good GTM strategies. It is the founder’s responsibility to drive rapid growth, not simply wait for it to happen.

### Final thoughts

It is my honor to have served 259k users, to have been supported by our amazing investors, team members, advisors, and partner companies; it is solely my responsibility that we weren’t able to make Datong a sustainable business.

I still firmly believe that high-quality information should be equally accessible to all people, regardless of their mother languages, education backgrounds, or political beliefs. Datong’s journey provides invaluable lessons for me and perhaps others to reflect upon. The pursuit of Great Unity lives on — and I hope to carry its spirit into whatever comes next.

### Acknowledgements

**Investors:** MiraclePlus has been incredibly supportive throughout the journey, provided us with office hours, cloud service credits, contact introductions, and unwavering support to all of our decisions. I am extremely grateful to be backed by such an investor, and I strongly recommend Chinese startups to apply for its support.

**Team:** Our talented team of part-time contributors and interns have been amazing. As mentioned earlier, each of them brought in unique insights, the product would be much less easy to use without any one of them.

**Advisors:** A few previously successful startup founders have served as advisors for this project, their insights have been crucial in many of our key roadmap decisions.

**Partners:** Many partners have provided dedicated custom support and generous credits for Datong’s service — Tencent Cloud, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Surfly, China United Network Communications, etc., Datong is truly a joint effort that wouldn’t be possible without these great service providers.

**Users:** Finally, I want to thank all users of Datong. Many users kindly shared their love for Datong and provided invaluable feedback. I read every comment across platforms and kept a record of them; they truly mean a lot to us. I hope to become more resourceful in the future to revamp Datong and to serve you all again.
